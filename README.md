# PSYC 917: Introduction to Cognitive Neuroimaging

Hello! Welcome to the PSYC 917 repository. Here you will find all of the tutorial notebooks used in the course.  

## Setting up

This course assumes that you have Python 3 installed using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Please ensure that you install the **Python 3.7** distribution for your operating system. If you do not wish to rely on Anaconda, you can simply install the dependencies (see 2) below).

Once you've either cloned or downloaded this repository, you need to do two things to ensure that everything will run properly:

1. Download the data. We use the data from [Gorgolewski et al (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641991/), which can be downloaded from OpenNeuro [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000114/versions/1.0.1). Once downloaded, rename the folder to `data` and move the folder inside the repository directory.

2. Install the dependencies. All dependencies are found in `requirements.txt` and can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. With Anaconda, many of these will already be installed.
