    "Within the last 10-15 years, Python's popularity has exploded in science. This is largely due to its easy syntax, large community, the development of some fundamental scientific computing packages, and its exceptional tooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "This course is not a course on learning Python, but rather a course on learning fMRI analysis. It just so happens to be that Python is an excellent choice for neuroimaging thanks to a number of packages that we'll use throughout the course. It is **not** expected that you need to know Python to participate in the course, but you will be introduced to Python syntax and some broader Python concepts along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing environments\n",
    "\n",
    "You are likely familiar with various types of scientific and statistical software. These tools might be 'interface-oriented' (e.g., Excel, SPSS), or programming-oriented (e.g., MATLAB, RStudio for R), but share one key feature: You can open up the application and begin working on your analysis right away. Therefore, the environment in which you perform your data analysis is nicely encapsulated in the application that you are using. Should you need to add external libraries to this environment, the application often makes it easy to do so. For scientists whose first priority is their science, not their computers, the user-friendly aspects of these tools are great. \n",
    "\n",
    "So where does Python fit in?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general purpose programming language. It is use for web development, simple computer programs, and science, among others. Because of its generality and use-case diversity, _there is no single application or interface for Python_. There are also _tons_ of packages, openly-developed by community members and freely available, that serve different purposes and make progamming in different fields possible (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone who wants to use Python has to _build their own computing environment_ by deciding on a) the application to program with, and b) the packages that they need to install. This flexibility is a _feature, not a bug_: Users can build their own computing environments and program in the way the best suits them. You can imagine that a web developer would probably have a very different computing environment than a scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For users coming from other tools such as MATLAB and R, this can seem daunting and unnecessary. It's hard to convince some people to switch over to Python for this reason. But, once you get past this step and begin diving into Python's scientific ecosystems, it becomes easy to see the benefit of the flexibility and generality that Python has to offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) has made the jump to Python for scientists much smaller. It provides a comprehensive Python distribution tailored towards scientific computing. It provides tons of data-related packages as well as tools that make programming scientific analyses and projects easy. We will be using Anaconda in the course, and we'll install some additional packages for neuroimaging that aren't included in the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, [you can download the Python 3.7 distribution for your operating system here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python 2 or 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python had an ugly transition from Python 2 to 3 that lasted the entire decade. Python 3 brought some fundamental changes to the language that were incompatible with Python 2. Many people were reluctant to switch, and packages were slow to add support for Python 3. So inevitably, beginners were faced with the big question: Python 2 or 3? Thankfully, Python 3 has been the clear answer for the last 4-5 years now. Support for Python 2 just stopped on January 1, and pretty much all of the big packages support Python 3 (in fact, many no longer support Python 2 at all).   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code typically lives in `.py` files. These can run as scripts or contain a collection of functions (called a 'module'). Unless you program more like a developer, Python files are often not ideal for the level of interactivity that science typically involves (although this is a big discussion topic and I seldom use notebooks as my main tool for a variety of reasons...). For instance, you often want to re-run something when you are tinkering with your code or making sure it is correct. MATLAB and R make this interaction easy by allowing line-by-line code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python took a fundamentally different approach to code interaction by introducing Ipython and subsequently Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks are a mixture of text and code cells that make it possible to interact with code and write meaningful text all in one document, exactly like a lab notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will use Jupyter notebooks extensively. We will use Jupyter Lab (which comes with Anaconda) to open and run notebooks (learn more about Jupyter [here](https://jupyter.org/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can run code cells by running `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter`). It will print out the result of the last line in the cell."
